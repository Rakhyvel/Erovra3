- Add sound
	- SOUND ANY TIME AN ORDER IS GIVEN!
	- SOUND ANY TIME AN ENTITY IS SPAWNED!
	- sound should get quieter as it gets farther from the camera, inverse square
	- should act as feedback, and let the user know about surroundings
x Remove the notion of a "TextureID", just use pointers to SDL_Textures
x Remove the notion of a "SoundID", just use pointers to Mix_Chunk
x erosion doesnt look good
x error in dikstra algorithm

3.10.x- Pivot
x More than one nation (Maybe an array of enemy nations)
	x Each unit has an entityID of their nation, not a flag
	x Procedurally generate more than two nations
	x Fix AI making too many planes
	x Fix AI not making replacement engineers

	x Add wall outline texture
	x Fog of war should be an option in match creation menu

	x Fix wall cost
	x Farm cost goes up even if you capture other farms?
	- Ports are reset, make that not so
	- Fix AI hesitation glitch
	- AI ground units shouldn't care about plane sightings
- Resources change
	- Farms produce food just like a resource producer
		- Is consumed by the units of a city
		- If no food, city happiness lowers (see lower)
		- Grain silos to store excess food
		- Does food go to the city? And units are assigned to each city?
	- Wood to build buildings
	- Oil for planes, drains and needs to be replenished or else they fall from the sky
		- Same thing as food, produced by other units, drained by each unit
- More non-combat units like miners, farmers
	- miners go out and can test soil, can set up mines, mines can pack up and leave
	- farmers, "     " farms
	- settlers "     " cities
		- Cities should be cheap to settle, scale linearly with how many cities there are
		- Quadratic to upgrade a city (or however much it would be depending on the coin rate, should remain relatively constant)
		- This would make 'outposts' possible
	- Gameplay:
		- 
- Academy trains other kinds of units
	- Pilots
- Cities can become restless, go rogue and spawn new rebel nations
	- Not enough food
	- Have a happiness meter
		- Building consumer goods in factories increaes this happiness
		- Naturally decreases
		- Decreases if food production is too low
		- Captured cities start with low happiness
- Buildings can be upgraded, but require more upkeep
- "Infinite" maps?
	- You'd only be able to see the terrain of what you've explored (GOOD IDEA!)
	- Store map data on disk, access when needed
	- Temporarily load the segments that the player views as textures
		- Would be efficient on memory
		- But would mean only things could only happen when the user is viewing (bad)
- TRANSPORT BOATS!!!!!! (cmon mane)
- Debug menu
	- Can time warp
	- Can show other nations
	- Show AI goals above the capital
	- Show AI visited tiles
	- Show port tiles
- Settings where you can turn down the volume!
- Swap "Surrender" and "Back to game" buttons in menu
- Fix city names, serialize the trie
- Different shapes for the mini map
- Build walls 3 tile radius around capital
- Increase attacker to fighter ratio

3.11.x- Multiplayer
- Order particles
	- Originate from nation's command post
	- Send messages to units to change their position, etc (this ties into my plans for multiplayer!)
	- Can upgrade command post to get faster messages
- Multiplayer
- Make it so that maps always have sea in the center only, and that AI will only build ships if they cant A* to other capital
- Buff factory speed if city other factories, etc with others
- Make mines way less lucrative
- A way to select to snap to a grid
- A way to reploy/retreat troops, would be a bit faster, wouldn't fight back, wouldnt be able to get closer to the enemy, but a smaller radius
- Fertility, along with ore. Affects how much food a farm gives


??? save game files
	- MAKE SURE that all component id's and stuff that might get serialized are final


misc.
- Premade maps?
- Stats at end of game?
- Sequential movement?
- Hints?
- AirToGroundBullet for attackers, descends from the ground
- Planes should originate from airfields, airfield should protect
? Defensive armament for bombers
- Can't stack units?
