	x Enemy units cannot move past wall, like water
		x Note: since they are always orthoganal, we can check the original x or y 
		  coord (depending on angle), and new x or y coord, and if the signs of the 
		  coord - wall coord changes, unit would cross wall, stop unit
	x Walls absorb enemy projectiles
		x Units shouldn't become engaged with walls

- Make AI build airfields and airplanes
	x If no air supremacy, build fighters
		x Should have at least 1 fighter, and then have the same number of fighters as the other team has planes
		x Should have half of units be ground, and the rest be air
	x Else, build attackers/bombers
	x Fighters should target other fighters, else other planes, else scout
	x Attackers and bombers go after their respective targets, like ground units do
		- Bombers are seriously screwed up, no bombers yet
x Make units favor tiles closer to their capital
x Make units stronger
x Ground units cannot target buildings if near enemies!
x Offset visited squares so that cities are in the center, add extra row/column, shift up/left 16 pxls


3.8.x- Economy, general tidying up of logic

	x Cities give default 3 to pop cap

	x Can end match (surrender), go back to main menu (FREE MEMORY!!)
	x Implement new hashmap system for scene
		x Randomized global keys
	x Add macro for Scene_HasComponents(scene, ComponentKey, ...), would be convenient

- Update coin sprite, ore sprite to be HD
- Enumerate unit divisions
- Give names to cities randomly

- Give height to shells with shadow as they go to their target
	- Shells shouldn't care about walls
- AirToGroundBullet for attackers, descends from the ground
- Vector graphics for every texture (no bitmaps!)
- Put progress bar above factories (it looks good)
- Fix building hover (probably should be none)
- Completely document code, with a python script to create HTML documentation for everything
- Defensive armament for bombers
- Planes should originate from airfields
- If you hover over a unit it will give you some text by that unit for it's type, number, health, etc.

3.10.x- Multiplayer
- Multiplayer
- More than one nation (Maybe an array of enemy nations)
- Make it so that maps always have sea in the center only, and that AI will only build ships if they cant A* to other capital


??? save game files
	- MAKE SURE that all component id's and stuff that might get serialized are final
	- Don't be like intel


misc.
- terrain should be vectorized
