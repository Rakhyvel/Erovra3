	x Enemy units cannot move past wall, like water
		x Note: since they are always orthoganal, we can check the original x or y 
		  coord (depending on angle), and new x or y coord, and if the signs of the 
		  coord - wall coord changes, unit would cross wall, stop unit
	x Walls absorb enemy projectiles
		x Units shouldn't become engaged with walls

	x Can build ships
- Add ships      
	- Stats		 ( A ,  D ,  S )
	- Landing    (-,   1/4,   2)	0.5 (7 coin, 3 ore) rectangle ship
		- Can carry ground units
		- Does not need a port to load/deploy units
	- Destroyer  (1/2, 1/2,   2)	0.5 (15 coin, 5 ore) ship with no stripe
		- Torpedos
	- Cruiser    (  1,   1,   1)	1 (30 coin, 10 ore?) ship with one stripe
		- Artillery
		- AA
		- Can carry ground units
	- Battleship (  2,   2, 1/2)	2 (60 coin, 20 ore) ship with two stripes
		- Artillery
		- Can carry ground units
		- Can carry transport ships
	- Ships should glide and drift, like they're on real water
		- Probably have some kind of friction force, and stuff
		- Ship determines best turn and speed, player just needs to enter targets for ships
- Ships get stored in port after being built, until they set sail
	- Can store ships in each bay
	- Can repair ships in a bay
	- Can load and unload ships with units in a bay


3.7.x- Airplanes
- Add airplanes (x fighter, - attacker, - bomber)
	x Can build in factories
	x Can select the target of a plane if player (should have to click on sprite, not shadow!)
- Add airfields
	- Can only build planes if the city has an airfield, will take off from city's airfield
	- Land, rearm, repair?
- Make AI build airfields and airplanes
- Planes shouldn't care about walls
- AI fighter planes should scout
! When a factory or city is changed from AI to Player, they are not focusable


3.8.x- Prettify
- "Layers" to order elements on screen based on depth
- Make GUI look better
	- Container background colors
	- Borders around elements
	- Centering of elements (specifically for main menu)
	- Copy Microsoft design doc
	- [G]raphics [M]arkup [L]anguage (Would be cool! (How would events work though?))
		- Each element could be specified with an alphanum ID, could then look up elements by ID and retreive their EntityID
		- Could also utilize tree structure 
			GUI_AssignButtonEvent(match, GUI_GetElemByID(match, tree, "root/factory_ready_container/orders_container/build_artillery_button"), &Match_BuildArtillery);
	- Add in-game pause menu
	- Have time be in real-time units instead of ticks
- Update action button text in real time
	- Add resources needed for each cost
	- Gray out invalid ones, with red text as to why
- Actual focus GUI menu
	- A mini map in the corner, with ore and oil data represented
- Add sound
	- SOUND ANY TIME AN ORDER IS GIVEN
	- SOUND ANY TIME AN ENTITY IS SPAWNED
	- sound should get quieter as it gets farther from the camera, inverse square
- Add particles
	- Shell explosion particles, maybe particles on its trajectory
- Add animations
	- GUI animations (ex. for focus menu) should use timing specified by Microsoft design doc
- Add arrow when moving a unit
- Add death animation
- Give coins a shadow, arc, and change their velocity based on their path
- Update coin sprite, ore sprite to be HD
- Enumerate unit divisions
- Give names to cities randomly
- Icons embedded in text
- A scrolling message box for messages about the game
- Alerts (should swing in like in War Thuder)
- Make producer menu show real time rather than ticks
- Give height to shells with shadow as they go to their target
	- Shells shouldn't care about walls
- Get better building images, make buildings close to their home city
	- Put progress bar above factories (it looks good)
- Fix building hover (probably should be none)
- Factories, airfields should be "close" to their respective cities
	- Ports should not, since they need to be in the center of a tile, an in water
- Completely document code, with a python script to create HTML documentation for everything


3.9.x- Cool stuff
- Simplify/reduce components
- Farms, food
- Mines (as in anti personel mines, not mines for ore)
- Training people
	- In order to build cavalry, you'd need to train people to be tankers etc
	- After training is done, increases trained score for the respective skills
	- Unskilled workers would work in farms/factories/ports/airfields etc
- Instead of pop cap, have a number of unemployed unskilled, unemployed skilled, etc
- Units retreat
- Units have a queue of targets instead of just one, can give them a path to follow
	- cycles can be achived by enqueueing after dequieing
- Projectiles should scan walls and see if they're hitting them, even at oblique angles

3.10.x- Multiplayer
- Multiplayer


??? save game files


misc.
- terrain should be vectorized
