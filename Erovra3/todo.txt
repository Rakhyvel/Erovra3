x Make alerts show on the second half of the minute, have countdown timers for all resources for accepters

3.11.x- AI and units
- TRANSPORT BOATS!!!!!! (cmon mane)
	- Can tell a unit to go inside a transport boat
		- Needs to be close enough to each other
		- Would be nice if it happened at a port
	- Units hovered near ports have a "board" button that is only active if the unit is in a port tile
		x "Board" button
			x The button is inactive unless the unit is in a port tile
			x There is a "board mode" boolean
			x Clicking the button sets this mode to true
			x Esc or closing the focus GUI sets this to false
		x Click a transport in the same port tile. Unit will then be childed to the transport
			x Maybe other units will darken so that you know which units you can select, or that a selection is even happening
			x No other units hover while in board mode
			x Would then hide the GUI of course
			x Boarded units should not do move, shoot, take damage, etc
	- Transport GUI
		x Can carry 3 units
		- For each unit, should show the unit's icon, it's name and ordinal, and it's health
		- Empty slots should just say "empty" or something
		- Cannot destroy transport with units inside
			- If the transport dies, all units inside should die as well
		- Create an icon for transports
	- When the transport lands, the units will be removed from the transport. Don't destroy the transport like in Java
- Defensive armament for bombers
	- AI knows about bombers
	- Destroyers get torpedos
	- Cruisers get torpedos and AA
	- Battleships get artillery (which can attack surface) and AA
	- AirToGroundBullet for attackers, descends from the ground
	- Attackers can attack ships
- AI Build walls 3 tile radius around capital
- AI engineers shouldn't go to warzones

	- toggle if you can focus enemy units
	- Can give spawn any resource particles! Or any units!
- Check if capitals are all on the same continent first, to make it faster
- Premade maps
- Tabs for map creation
	- Save map settings into a sharable string
- Map seeds should be base 64, only 6 or 7 long (5 * 6 = 8 * 4 = 32 bit integer seed)
- Randomize buttons next to things people might want to randomize, instead of just one
- Slider for center bias in map maker
- Settings where you can turn down the volume!
- Can adjust key bindings for things
- Redo the loading circle with correct color and better transparency, also make sure it's anti aliased
- Error messages are clipped
- Scroll for containers
- A box in the minimap that shows where the camera is
	- Can click on minimap to pan camera there
- Resizable minimap
- Camera shouldn't go out of bounds
- Different shapes for the units on mini map
	- ESPECIALLY for walls
- more hints, hints.txt file

3.13.x- OOBE
- Actual real speech box hints when you first start playing about what to do
- Time how long it takes to play, make sure the first 20% makes sense
- Alert about low food
- Crash message boxes instead of console
- If too close to another city / building, show that city/building
- A message that you can't build planes without airfield
- In game hints that uses the AI to give hints
- An indication of where you can build ports and expanions and cities

3.14.x- Controls
- A way to select to snap to a grid
- Arrow spines should be curved back a bit
	- Bezier curve, like the inverse of the axe blade
- Arrows should begin slightly after units (make it happen)
- Arrows should not overlap at the tip
- Scrolling while giving arrow orders should scroll the offset for units
	- Holding shift while scrolling rotates the end formation
- Tooltips?

3.15.x- Multiplayer

	- Originate from nation's capital
	- Send messages to units to change their position, orders, etc (this ties into my plans for multiplayer!)

??? save game files

- PUBLISH!!!!!!!!!
	- erovra.net (maybe a different name?)
	- Youtube channel, email account
	- Video tutorials
	- Make it cross platform?
	- How does this make money?
		- Free to play against AI
		- Need to pay for an account to play with others
	- Work out loud
		- Streams
		- Dev logs
	- Twitter/Instagram
		- GIFs and videos! Few text
		- Different! Unique stuff!
	- Buy ads
		- Know your target audience

misc.
- Stats at end of game?
- Sequential movement?
- Planes should originate from airfields, airfield should protect
- Can't stack units?
- Modding API
- Wells for water, maybe used for powerplants?
- Oil for planes, tanks, ships, drains and needs to be replenished when they move or else they fall from the sky
	- Same thing as food, produced by other units, drained by each unit
	- Crude oil is pumped out of the ground
	- Turned into gasoline by a refinery, which is what planes actually use	
		- Oil drill
			- Electricity = crude oil
		- Refinery
			- electricity + crude oil = gas
? Storage units that accept particles, reemit them, have a lower priority distance multiplier (512)
? Ammo & shells & bombs as ingredients to make units
